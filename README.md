# Building your Own

This repository contains the CAD and Arduino firmware to build the box but does not contain the schematic/PCB that I used. Sorry, don't have that around at the moment.

Parts list:
- Various 3d printed parts (in `/hardware`)
- Arduino Pro Micro + Breakout PCB (`/pcb`)
- Small LiPo battery
- M4 or M5 Socket Head Screw (for Hinge)
